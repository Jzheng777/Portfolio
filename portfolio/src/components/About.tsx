      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I’m Jason Zheng, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.

Throughout my studies, I've honed my skills in web development, AI, and game design. Leading a team of five, I developed Power Chess, a Chinese chess website, where I focused on front-end development and deployment. In another project, I implemented Sarsa and Q-learning algorithms for optimal pathfinding in an AI environment.

With expertise in Python, JavaScript, and various web development tools, I’ve contributed to projects ranging from secure quiz apps to interactive games. I’m passionate about UI/UX design and thrive in collaborative environments.

Let’s connect and discuss how we can innovate together!</p>
